# file format:
# Lines of comment start with '#' and are only allowed at the beginning of the file
# Empty lines are not allowed.
# The first line not being a comment has to specify the file type. Here Cuboid.
# The next line has to be an integer indicating, how many cuboids there are.
#
# Cuboid data consists of
# * The coordinate of the lower left front-side corner (3 double values)
# * Number of particles of dimension N1 (1 unsigned integer value)
# * Number of particles of dimension N2 (1 unsigned integer value)
# * Number of particles of dimension N3 (1 unsigned integer value)
# * Distance of the particles (1 double value)
# * Mass of one particle (1 double value)
# * Initial velocity of the particles (3 double values)
# * Mean value of the velocity of the Brownian Motion (1 double value)
